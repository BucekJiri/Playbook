# Apple Developer Accounts 
# ðŸŒŸ

* Create an Apple ID on your Nodes email
* Have Service Desk add you to the project you need by making an Access Request (Internal) request here https://nodes-internal.zendesk.com/
* Remember to ask for access to create certificates and provisioning profiles (there's an extra checkbox they have to check if they add you as Developer)
* Service Desk will monitor certificate expiry (mostly for push notifications)
* QA / Service Desk are responsible for releases. They will create screenshots, what's new in version, etc and take care of the AppStore Connect page
* CI should be setup to upload production builds to Test Flight. You shouldn't have to build and upload manually. If someone asks you to do that, ask for more time to setup CI correctly.
